# In draw.py, implement the BokehGraph class. The constructor should accept a 
# Graph object (as you implemented in part 1), and optionally other parameters
# configuring e.g. graphical settings. The show method should use Bokeh to 
# generate and display HTML that draws the graph - the included Pipfile will 
# install Bokeh and necessarily dependencies.This is purposefully open-ended, 
# so feel free to get creative. But also, ask questions to avoid being blocked, 
# and generally discuss and work from lecture examples.
